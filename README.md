# My First Challenge Project ! 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The first thing that I did was to double check the accessibility of the webpage.

Then I went through and looked over the HTML to make sure it was easy to read and semantic when you veiw the HTML elements.

I then added ALT attributes to the images to make sure they were accesssable to all.

Then I created a esay to read order to the flow of the pages both CSS and HTML to make sure they are easly trackable and readable.

When the title is seen it is easy to know and understand what this page is doing.
